## Open Projects 2021

## Abstract
The main aim of this project is to draw a desired sketch on a wall.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>We always want to draw pictures from what we see scrolling on the web. But it's always difficult to convince the professional painter to draw the exact same picture on our walls. This project helps users to draw the exact same sketch that they have uploaded.</p>

## Mechanism and Control

  The logic of our bot is shown in below figure:

  The left upper corner of workspace area is set as origin. We have all the coordinates in the form of an array and for each coordinates, we calculate the length of both the string from the above figure. Using the data, Steps per MM for each motor, we convert the length of the strings to the steps value for both the motors.
  
## Mechanical Aspect of the Design
   #### 1.Pulley Movement
   Used Stepper motors to rotate pulleys and helps the pen to reach desired coordinate.

   #### 2.Pen Module
   The pen module which is a disc contains 3 pen holders and the disc rotates using a stepper motor and then there are ball bearings that ease the rotation of the disc.

   #### 3.Pen Lifting
   Reck and Pinion mechanism helps us to lift the whole bot by providing perpendicular force on the wall while the pen module is in the process of rotation.

## Electronics Aspect of the Design
 In this project, OpenCV is used for image processing and the coordinates are stored in the form of a 30-30 array. Which are sent to arduino through serial transfer library. Then every coordinate is transformed into the length of two strings, which is again converted into number of steps of individual stepper motors.

## Simulation
We had imported Cad model into simulink and added wall and two clamps such that one end of the strings rest on it 
. Also we added blocks of  belt in simulink which acts like strings.We gave continuous commands in form of radians to the cylinders which helps to rotate the  pulleys and wind up the belt such that we get to move the bot to the desired positions.

## Applications

* The wall art bot is planned to draw or sketch a picture which the user has in his laptop or phone.
* This bot has three pen holders so, it can draw a picture with three different colors.

## Limitations

* If the two points from where the two strings are attached are not in the same level then the drawn picture will also be tilted.

* The dimension of the picture should not go beyond the workspace area of the bot( although the workspace area can be increased by increasing the distance between two points where strings are attached).

## Future Improvements
Raspberry pi can be used instead of Arduino to overcome the problem with limited storage. And also an app can be developed such that user can upload the picture directly from the phone.
